The AI is getting better at making movies. Here's how it works. First, you upload your favorite movie to the AI. Then, it analyzes the scene by scene and character by character. It looks for the most important elements, like the camera angle, the lighting, the music, the dialogue, and the action. It then creates a new movie that's exactly like the original, but with the AI's unique style. This is a huge step forward for AI,
